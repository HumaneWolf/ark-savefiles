# ARK: Survival Evolved - Save Game Reverse Engineering

The goal for this project is to reverse engineer and document the format of the save games in the game ARK: Survival Evolved.

There is no guarantee it will ever be finished, and no time schedule for it's completion or for support for future save game format updates.

## Save Format

ARK uses it's own binary save game format, rather than a standardized format. The format is documented in the wiki for this repository.

In addition, python scripts which read the save file is included, as an example of how to read the save sequentially.

## Licence

The work is released under a MIT licence, however, giving credits is appreciated.

This work is derived from [Qowyn](https://github.com/Qowyn/ark-savegame-toolkit) work with older save game versions.
